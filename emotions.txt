Happy
-----

 - major scales

Sad
----

 - minor scales


Scale generation algorithm:

c, c#, d, e, 


sadness - major scales
hapiness - minor scales
anger - b major, faster and more abrupt

Major scales:

2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 1

Minor scales:

2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2

Step 0.5: Recieve the emotion.
Step 0.75: Choose the major, minor or b major.
Step1 : choose the starting note.
Step2 : generate the scale in which all the notes will be chosen

Step 3 

Midi code:
----------

Note on
-------
1001 CCCC
0PPP PPPP
0VVV VVVV

where CCCC is the midid channel??? from 0 to 15
PPP PPPP is the pitch value form 0 to 127
VVV VVVV is the velocity value from 0 to 127

C is represented by 60 follows in half steps

Note off
---------
1000 CCCC
0PPP PPPP
0VVV VVVV


FOr each note
--------------

generate the pitch from a range 40 to 100
generate the note from a range of 36 to 84

generate a start note sequence, generate an endnote sequence

For example a singe c note at 64:

1001 0000
0011 1110
0100 0000

1000 0000
0011 1110
0000 0000



public void emotion(String em){

    if (em == "")

}

public String chooseStartingNote(int num){

    

}

public void chooseTypeOfScale(String emotion){

    //assign type of scale depending on the emotion that was transmitted

}

public void generate Scale (String startingNote){



}
